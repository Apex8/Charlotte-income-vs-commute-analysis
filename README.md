Charlotte Census block groups analysis:

    With charlotte being one of the largest growing metro areas in the united states at the moment our team felt it would be a good idea to take a look at some population metrics and find a correlation between household income and commuting to work. Hoping to find a large correlation between higher paying jobs in the Charlotte metro area, and single person commuting.  Along with more people in poverty having a diverse set of ways to get to work. 

1. Do people with higher paying jobs tend to commute alone more?

2. Do people with lower paying jobs tend to use a more varried array of ways to get to work?

3. Where is the area with the lowest average income and their perferred method of commuting?

4. Where is the area with the highest average income and their perferred method of commuting?

5. Where is an area with the closest to city wide average income and their perferred method of commuting?

6. What do these metrics tell us about the city of charlotte?

7. Are there more people that live and work in the same area when that area is closer to uptown/ do more people walk to work the closer they live to uptown?

8. Do rural areas have more single occupancy commuters?

9. Where is the biggest change in commuting style in the blocks?
