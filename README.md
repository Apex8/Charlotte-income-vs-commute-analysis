Charlotte Census block groups analysis

	With charlotte being one of the largest growing metro areas in the united states at the moment our team felt it would be a good idea to take a look at some population metrics and find a correlation between household income and commuting to work. Hoping to find a large correlation between higher paying jobs in the Charlotte metro area, and less commuting time or no commuting time at all.
	
1.	Does a higher paying job mean less commuting time?

2.	Do people with higher paying jobs live closer to work?

3.	Where is the area with the most people commuting the longest?

4.	Where is the area with the highest average income?
