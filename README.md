Charlotte Census block groups analysis

	With charlotte being one of the largest growing metro areas in the united states at the moment our team felt it would be a good idea to take a look at some population metrics and find a correlation between household income and commuting to work. 
	Hoping to find a large correlation between higher paying jobs commuting alone and lower paying jobs using a variety of different ways to get to work.
	
1. Where are Charlotte's income blocks? over 200K? Median? under 10K?

2. For each income block what is their perferred method of transport?

3. Where is the income block with the biggest change to this perferred method of transport? (Ex. 20000-30000 shows a large number of people carpooling and commuting alone)

Charlotte NC has its own API’s available for free to use by anyone, these data sets are both for years 2011-2015, so while not a current analysis it should be enough data to see trends and analyze for the future.
